It is believed that the history of the appearance of cats next to a person begins about 10-12 thousand years ago and is connected with the fact that these animals have become close to people since the time when the latter began to lead a sedentary lifestyle. This, by the way, makes cats simply unique among all animals, many of which still try to stay away from people.

A lot of controversy is also caused by the history of the origin of cats, which is also very ambiguous. The most common opinion, which, by the way, especially took root in Russia, is that the only ancestor of modern cats is the Western Asian North African steppe cat, which was domesticated not in Egypt at all, but in Nubia, and this happened about 4 thousand years ago. Only after that, cats came to Egypt, and then appeared in Asia, where they successfully interbred with forest Bengal species.
       <h2>Cats in Egypt</h2>
      
       In ancient Egypt, cats were very popular pets. By exterminating rodents, they protected crops and saved people from epidemics, primarily plague. They also hunted vipers, of which there were many in Egypt, and could even participate in bird hunting or fishing, that is, they were used as hunting animals, like modern dogs.

Sacred Egyptian cat.
In general, cats were considered sacred animals, associating them with various gods. So, it was believed that the supreme Egyptian god Ra took on the appearance of a red cat when he fought the serpent Apep in the kingdom of the dead. And cat-Ra defeated the snake, as Egyptian cats defeated African vipers!

And in Egypt they worshiped Bast, or Bastet, the goddess of joy, love and fertility, who was depicted with a female body and a cat's head. Bast was considered the daughter of the sun god Ra and the moon goddess Hathor. Merciful, supportive of people, Bast wore a cat's head, and the angry goddess was portrayed with a lion's head. The lioness-Bast brought death to the enemies. A whole city, Bubastis, was dedicated to the goddess and her sacred cats. A magnificent temple was built there, and crowded holidays were held.

Egyptian goddess Bastet.
It is not surprising that the Egyptians were very respectful towards animals dedicated to the great gods. At every temple where cats lived, a "guardian of cats" served, and this important position was inherited. For killing a cat, even unintentionally, the perpetrator could pay with his life.

When a cat died in the house, all household members shaved their eyebrows as a sign of mourning, and the body of the dead cat was mummified, that is, they kept it from decomposition with the help of
