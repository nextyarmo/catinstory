      <center><h2>Cats in North Africa</h2><p>Many argue that the ancient Egyptians were the first to tame and domesticate cats, but there is no general opinion on this matter. It is believed that the history of the appearance of cats next to a person begins about 10-12 thousand years ago and is connected with the fact that these animals have become close to people since the time when the latter began to lead a sedentary lifestyle. This, by the way, makes cats simply unique among all animals, many of which still try to stay away from people

      <p>A lot of controversy is also caused by the history of the origin of cats, which is also very ambiguous. The most common opinion, which, by the way, especially took root in Russia, is that the only ancestor of modern cats is the Western Asian North African steppe cat, which was domesticated not in Egypt at all, but in Nubia, and this happened about 4 thousand years ago. Only after that, cats came to Egypt, and then appeared in Asia, where they successfully interbred with forest Bengal species.

      <h2>Cats in Egypt</h2>
      <p>
      In ancient Egypt, cats were very popular pets. By exterminating rodents, they protected crops and saved people from epidemics, primarily plague. They also hunted vipers, of which there were many in Egypt, and could even participate in bird hunting or fishing, that is, they were used as hunting animals, like modern dogs. Sacred Egyptian cat. In general, cats were considered sacred animals, associating them with various gods. So, it was believed that the supreme Egyptian god Ra took on the appearance of a red cat when he fought the serpent Apep in the kingdom of the dead. And cat-Ra defeated the snake, as Egyptian cats defeated African vipers! And in Egypt they worshiped Bast, or Bastet, the goddess of joy, love and fertility, who was depicted with a female body and a cat's head. Bast was considered the daughter of the sun god Ra and the moon goddess Hathor. Merciful, supportive of people, Bast wore a cat's head, and the angry goddess was portrayed with a lion's head. The lioness-Bast brought death to the enemies. A whole city, Bubastis, was dedicated to the goddess and her sacred cats. A magnificent temple was built there, and crowded holidays were held. Egyptian goddess Bastet. It is not surprising that the Egyptians were very respectful towards animals dedicated to the great gods. At every temple where cats lived, a "guardian of cats" served, and this important position was inherited. For killing a cat, even unintentionally, the perpetrator could pay with his life. When a cat died in the house, all household members shaved their eyebrows as a sign of mourning, and the body of the dead cat was mummified, that is, they kept it from decomposition with the help of a special treatment - embalming. Mourning was worn for 70 days, so much time was usually taken by mummification. There were special Egyptian cemeteries where the burials of cat mummies were located. Abyssinian cat. Many cat mummies have survived to this day, with their help zoologists have restored the appearance of the most common pets in Egypt. They were medium-sized cats, lean, reddish, with a uniform coat color. Most of all modern cats look like representatives of the Abyssinian breed, whose ancestors also come from Africa. The Egyptians forbade the export of cats outside the borders of their state. But when Egypt was conquered by Rome in 30 BC, the cats, taken out by the victorious Romans, quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. The Egyptians used cats as hunting animals. In one ancient Egyptian fresco, a cat scares away birds in the Nile swamps. The fresco is almost 3500 years old and was found in ancient Thebes (the modern city of Luxor).

     <h2>But how did cats come to be successful?</h2>                       
      <p>To answer this question, we will have to go back 66 million years ago, to a time when there were still several million years before the appearance of felines (Feliformia). In those days, the Miacidae family appeared, whose representatives were supposedly the ancestors of the carnivores (Carnivora). And the first Carnivora were the ancestors of the cats (Feliformia) and dogs (Caniformia). Members of the Miacidae family were small carnivores who ran through the trees and hunted for medium-sized prey. They presumably preferred insects, lizards, and small birds. A typical representative of this family is Dormaalocyon latouri, who lived about 56-47 million years ago. Its weight did not exceed one kilogram. This animal is one of the few known to science that can be classified as a common ancestor (or close to a common ancestor) of dogs and cats. Unfortunately, there is not much data on this period of cat evolution. And the reason for this lies in the habitat of these animals. They lived in the forest, and this area (despite the abundance of living organisms) is not suitable for fossilization (formation of fossils). After all, animals dying in the forest can be immediately eaten by other animals. And if no one found the corpse, then it will rot without it. So that the skeleton simply does not have time</p>

     <h2>History of the Siberian cat - Russia.</h2>
     <p>For the first time, cats similar to Siberian ones are mentioned in publications of the 17th century about the city of Kansk, Krasnoyarsk district, Yenisei province. Then they were called "Bukhara". They could be found everywhere in the Russian kingdom. There is no exact data on when and how Bukhara cats appeared in Siberia. At that time, the indigenous inhabitants of Siberia led a predominantly nomadic lifestyle. But there were also large camps (settlements) in Siberia - the headquarters of the khans, where the settled population kept livestock, cats and dogs. During the colonization of Siberia by Russian settlers, they brought with them domestic animals and cats to fight rodents. Bukhara cats came to Siberia with merchants who arrived from the Central Asian countries, with whom there was an active trade at that time. It is possible that Angora, Siberian and Persian cats had common Asian ancestors. Russian merchants from Veliky Ustyug and Lalsk (Vologda province), who were engaged in the XVI-XVII centuries. various trade, along with the goods they brought home long-haired Siberian cats, which took root there. The Siberian cat as a breed was formed on the territory of the Urals and east of the Urals - in Siberia. Severe weather conditions, an abundance of snow, severe frosts and winds contributed to the appearance of a long dense coat and thick undercoat in the Siberian cat, protecting the animal from the cold. Siberian cats are widespread in the north of the European part of Russia, in the central and western regions of the country.<br>

     <h2>Ukrainian Levka - Ukraine</h2>
     <br>
     <p>Work on the creation of the breed began in 2000. Sketches of the appearance of the cat, the definition of the breed and the choice of genotypes, reflecting the phenotype, was performed by felinologist Biryukova Elena Vsevolodovna. The first registered cat of the ICFA RUI breeding commission named "Levkoy Primero" was born on January 21, 2004.<br>

     <h2>Thai Cat - Thailand</h2>  
   <p>The first depiction of cats of the Thai type is found in 14th-century manuscripts kept in government laboratories in Bangkok.

Almost the same as the current cats are drawn, Siamese cats of the late 19th-20th century looked like, whose appearance has come down to us thanks to the few sources of photographs found.

The first representatives of Siamese cats fell ill first in Europe (1884), then in America (after 1920). Almost immediately, intensive breeding of this exotic breed began for felinologists of that time. As a result of selection work, the Siamese species became variable and acquired an increased and refined type with a wedge-shaped head, large ears and build-up of slender slimy paws. The old type was relegated to the background and survived only thanks to enthusiasts and lovers of the old-type (according to another terminology, apple-headed, from English apple-headed) Siamese - modern Thais.

The first mention of Thai cats in Russia dates back to the 18th century[1]: in the Penza province, near the settlement of Insar, the German naturalist PS Pallas saw cats and was struck by their unusualness. In the book "Journey through the southern provinces of the Russian state in the period 1773-1788" he describes this meeting.

It is known that the Siamese king Chulalongkorn presented Nicholas II with 200 Siamese cats. Nikolay, in gratitude for this gift to the Swiss Rama V, guards department for the protection of the Great Royal Court.[2] In the 1950s, S.V. Obraztsov brought several cats from a tour of Europe. This type of cat is found in many homes, as people tried to cross similar cats. A breeding pearl in Russia has been a professional occupation only since the 1980s, so the old type in it did not have time to change. In 1990, a standard was approved in Germany, the breed was officially recognized in the WCF system and became known as Thai in honor of the new name of the state of Siam, renamed in Thailand.

Currently, the Thai cat breed is closed, however, by solving the problem of the animal club, a phenotypically related standard, an error in breed identification (certification) and participation in experimental breeding can be detected. First, a felinologist naturally examines, and if the cat (cat) meets the standard, the club "gets the go-ahead" on the club's reviews by experts. It is necessary to obtain two subscriptions from experts to obtain a certificate of conformity to the breed. If a cat (cat) could not get a certificate, then it cannot be spoken Thai, but remains only similar to Thai. Obtaining a certificate of conformity to the breed, participation in the reception in families of different reception[3]. In some cases, this rock is called Diamond gold.</p>
